# My personal NvChad custom config.

## Installation

1. Follow [instructions](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install) and install NvChad. 

Do **not** install example custom config. 

2. Clone this repository as `custom` subdir of NvChad's `lua` directory.

```sh
$ cd ~/.config/nvim/lua
$ git clone https://github.com/phpeek/NvChad-config.git custom
```

3. Start / restart NvChad.

## Updating NvChad

As `custom` directory is ignored by NvChad by default, this should not interfere
with regular `:NvChadUpdate` command.
